DH Pottery and Glass is the name of my project.
It will be a website/app that will have my dad's site as well as a login to an interactive
place to design your own pottery.

I think the stories that I need to work out will be.

-a login
-navigation to design pottery
-ability to choose what clay,glaze,color,mold, ect...
-price calculator
-check out
